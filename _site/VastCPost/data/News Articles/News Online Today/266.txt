PUBLISHED: 5 February 2012
LOCATION: ABILA, Kronos
TEXT: Four Protectors of Kronos members were arrested by Abila police last week on false drug charges.  The four citizens were attending evening poetry readings at a local caf.  Witnesses report that police stormed the caf, ignoring everyone but those four specific persons.  It is increasingly evident that the persecution of the POK has become official government policy.
